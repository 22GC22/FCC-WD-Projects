                <p>The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

                <p>    It is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.

                 <p>Python is an interpreted high-level general-purpose programming language. Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant indentation.

                <p>Python is a general-purpose coding languageâ€”which means that, unlike HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it can be used for other types of programming and software development besides web development. That includes back end development, software development, data science and writing system scripts among other things.

                </p>
                <p>Most often Java is used to build large enterprise class applications. Java works great within corporate environments, or if you're building a very large scale system. Although it can be used for small tasks, it's less suited for that.
